Hey IGNers!

Huge thanks to the crew at IGN, and a specific shout out to Community champion Kallie, for giving my last Raspberry Pi project space on the front page! Thanks to that I've been able to become employed, doing Raspberry Pi related projects and writing about them for element14.

I got some interest in my teased project of installing a Raspberry Pi in my car, and I've done that with an added plus - using the Raspberry Pi camera to make car DVR system. The main purpose is to have a solid video record in case you have a crash or other 'traffic incident', making insurance claims that much easier. Look at this video for an awkward me showing you how the whole thing works:

If you want to read up in more details, head over to the [full article here at element14](http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/raspberrypi_projects/blog/2015/06/23/the-secrets-of-the-pi-camera--car-dvr-system). Also included is a long video drive through rural small town New Zealand! It's very exciting, for more fun try counting the number of sheep you can see.

If you have any ideas of cool projects you'd like to see me make, buzz me up here, at element14 or on Twitter -Â [@aaronights](http://twitter.com/aaronights). I'm game for anything! Just call me Ben Heck Junior.
