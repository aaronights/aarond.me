Things I liked and regularly used that Ziff Davis sold off, drastically downsized or outright killed:

* DL.tv
* Cranky Geeks
* ExtremeTech
* Computer Gaming World / GFW
* PC Magazine
* 1UP.com
* Electronic Gaming Monthly
* FileFront

Things I like and regularly use that Ziff Davis currently owns:

* IGN

I'm not trying to light fires, just voice my concerns.

Know this: The current Ziff Davis isn't the same one that did all this massacring. It was recently brought by another company (J2 Global), so hopefully this means past trends wont happen all over again.

The biggest concern I've heard in all this recent news is Uncle Ziff wanting to do some 'Streamlining'. Murdering 1UP and Gamespy does give more focus, but IGN has fingers in many pies. Streamlining could result in some of the supplemental content that has more of a niche audience being killed.

IGN wont die, but I really think there is a chance that it could become something radically different.
