I was recently  contacted to help an eldery person in my small town to help get his printer working. Currently it was consistently printing poorly, with text being very blurred and smudged.

My plan was to start simple, and work up from there.

_Spoilers: My hands get dirty!_

First was a head clean. Doing this would also print a test pattern to let me see what the specific problem could be. It took a while, but the resulting pattern was rather fuzzy. The edges of fonts had trails and lacked any sharp edges. Just like what I was told!

I tried using the printers auto alignment function next. This would do all kinds of magic to make sure the heads of the printer were somewhat in line with what the software was expecting. This seemed to improve things slightly, but not resolve the issue entirely.

Next up was a manual head align. This is a process where the printer outputs an A4 page full of various different patterns, then you inspect them all and apply the settings to the printer based on what patterns are the most accurate. This is done for each printing head: Black, Cyan, Magenta and Yellow.

The trouble is that none of the resulting patterns were good enough. Now it was time to get a little dirty.

I disassembled the printer to get access to the actual print heads and removed them. The heads didn’t seem extremely dirty, but could still be improved.

_The polished printer heads._

I used cotton swabs and isopropyl alcohol to polish up the heads. Surprisingly, a lot of built up dried ink came off that wasn’t very obvious with a simple visual inspection. After cleaning it, I left it out to dry for an hour. After putting it back in the printer I went for another head clean.

It was better, but still not ideal.

I went in much deeper and disassembled the printing head assembly. It was flooded with excessive ink. Googling for more information showed that a plastic plate inside the head should be clean and white, but this one was soaked in ink. I cleaned it out as best as I could, but still couldn’t get it shiny and white like most example photos online were.

_That should be completely white._

I put it all back together, and another test page showed very little improvement.

I was now reasonably sure that the fault was either with the ink cartridges or a defect in the printing head. No amount of cleaning was going to resolve this issue, and any further diagnosis would require extra parts to test if my idea had any merit.

So, not a great result. It still was better than when I started! It’s unfortunate that getting replacement parts for this printer could very well cost more than an entirely new printer of an updated model.
