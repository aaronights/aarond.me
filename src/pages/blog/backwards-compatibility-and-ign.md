Is the lack of backwards compatibility in the Playstation 4 a big problem? Will this generation of games live on for after the release of the next generation of hardware? Is Gaikai viable?

Also, what is happening with IGN? If you're a contributor to the IGN community, do you have concerns? Do you own what you contribute? What do the new owners of IGN have planned for the future?
