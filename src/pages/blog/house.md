It was nice to have it all.

For a while there, I was on top of the world! I've never felt that before… being happy and secure. I did everything I could for my partner, showering her with flowers, gifts and vacations. I’d drive all night to keep her warm.

It was amazing to feel so wanted and appreciated by someone I loved and admired so much. She always wanted to be with me, and I wanted to be with her even more. Since my dad passed away, I thought my life would have to be a compromise and I’d end up living a mediocre life with someone I just got along with. But no, somehow I found myself having someone who was everything I had ever dreamed of.

The times we had together were just amazing. Perfect! I tried so hard to treat her like a princess. 

We went on the most amazing vacations I could imagine. The most amazing scenery, luxury accommodation and the fanciest dining experiences on offer. They were nice places, but the highlight for me was always being with her.

She has a tough job, with varied hours, and something I'll always remember fondly was bringing her dinner and eating with her in my car - no matter if it was at 6pm or 2am. More than once I left my home at 4 in the morning just to be there when she got home from a night shift.

I even tried making meals! I’m not the best chef, but I got good at cooking a few dishes. My eggs Benedict might not have been as good as the local cafe, but it was… enjoyable, apparently! I tried to make cookies and cupcakes that were inspired by her favourite things - like a Milky Bar cookie cupcake, or loaded caramel sandwich cookies.

I loved getting her flowers. I tried to keep them varied, always striving to get colours and styles that matched the mood and weather of the day. I got really good at knowing where the best stores were on the long drive over to her place. She was always so appreciative, it made me feel amazing.

I'd leave in the morning to head to work, and less than a minute down the road I'd get a message saying how much she missed me already.

Now, distance was an issue. It's about a 2 hour drive between my house and where she was living. My work occasionally lined up, where I could clock off and then see her afterwards, but because of her shift based work it was tough. It was a lot of driving - I must have spent ten dozen hours over the past eight months commuting over that winding road!

To make it easier, we looked into buying a house together near where she lives. And we did! Kind of. I wouldn't call it a house - it was a shell of a dwelling. A renovator’s dream! It was at a bargain price, too good to turn down.

_Memories are made of art._

I couldn't be there as much as she could. She lived two minutes away, and I was two hours away. We were really trying to do things as cheaply as we could, relying on her family to do a lot of the work for a bargain price.

I was anxious the whole way. I've very much inherited my father's habit of getting worried about money.  

I tried to compensate for not being able to be there by paying some of the larger bills myself, but I moaned about this all the time. She got frustrated having to deal with me and my issues with the money involved in the house.

Now, my work situation is complicated. I’m a contractor, so if I don’t work I don’t get paid. And if I start being more whimsical with when I work, I get a strong impression they’d take my job away. I took the odd day off here and there, but I was so paranoid that I'd run out of money for this house. I was working late during the week then working at the new house most weekends. When I was at the house working by myself I'd often not do stuff right. My painting, sanding, prepping and even nailing just wasn't good enough. She had an eye for detail that I just couldn't grasp.

I was trying! It was hard, dusty, sweaty work. But no amount of effort could compensate for my lack of skill. Plus, as more time and effort got spent on this house, the less time and effort there was for us. That made me get grumpy, bitter and difficult. 

It was too much. She couldn’t go on. She wanted to buy my half of the house and put our relationship on hold. That hit me so hard. I went into this to make the relationship better, and now it was corrupting it. 

At times I tried to win her back. I tried to shower her with kindness, gifts and love. This only made it harder for her - it made her feel like I was pressuring her for something she didn’t want right now, pushing her away even more. Then I got mean and tried to be difficult. I tried to make selling her my half of the house seem very difficult, under the hopes that we couldn’t do it and then we’d have to stay together.

When it came to selling her my half, I had two sides fighting over me with what to do. 

We had come to an agreement to sell my half to her at just the same amount that I had put into the house. I wouldn’t make any profit, just walking away breaking even.

My sister, friends and family had another perspective. Work out the current market rate of the house, and use that to come to a price. 

My plan was to do the first option, despite the objections from those around me. But then I saw a lawyer. She was a savvy one! She knew the going rate of the market, and made me feel like an idiot for selling half of this house for so much under the market value. Houses are going up at a rate of $1000 a day! I should get more than double this amount! I didn’t want to hide anything from the lawyer. I explained everything. I explained the original plan for the house, the agreement we had made and how we signed a hand written agreement on the back of a cardboard box. The lawyer, acting in my best interest, was horrified. She told me just how much I was being ripped off, and how much of a bully my now ex-partner was being by pushing me into this agreement.

I was reminded of some not very nice feelings. To think this woman that I had done so much for was doing one over on me. She had hurt me! Pushed me away! And it wasn’t fair! If she wants to sell? Then maybe I should go into battle with this lawyer on my side. I had given her so much! I felt so small and stupid. Everyone I knew and cared about reassured me this was the right thing to do - go to the lawyer and take her advice. I felt… horrible. So the lawyer and I drafted an email on the spot stating that market value would be what I’d want, and sent it off.

I phoned my sister and outright asked for reassurance that I was doing the right thing, and she gave it to me. 

The phone conversation I had with my ex-partner was… blunt. It’s all I could do. I was told that she hated me and wished she’d never met me. I stoically stood by what my lawyer had written. 

I didn’t hear anything from anyone for the next few days. Then, from out of nowhere, I got a call.

She asked to talk. I told her I was finishing up a job just down the road from her. It was against all advice, but I agreed to go and see her.

She looked so beautiful. The first thing she wanted was a hug.

She took the time to calmly explain the finances going on with the house. There was a boatload of bills mounting up! Thanks to her sister's partner, we had got an amazing deal on the house, and he was willing to back her up in any court proceedings.

She said she couldn’t imagine her future without me, but I was screwing her over so much. 

When I left that house I felt very… empty, like my ethereal soul had blinked out of existence. I got a little bit down the road, and drafted a letter to this lawyer asking her to put together a Sales and Purchase agreement for the initial agreed cost price. I phoned and told her. She was so relieved. That phone call ended with her telling me she loves me, and I reciprocated.

Now I feel completely lost, and there's no one to send out a search party. I would love to be what she wants, but right now that's a far fetched fantasy. She has been very clear that she doesn't want a relationship, and I'm not sure she'd let me be a close friend. She still feels betrayed by me, and I understand that.

Buying a house together so early in our relationship wasn't smart. I would give anything to find out what happened to us in another universe where we didn't do this. Did the strain of renovating the house kill us? Or did it just bring ahead the inevitable? I hate hindsight, it’s frustrating! Have I ruined the best thing that ever happened to me? Did I spend all of the good luck I have in getting this amazing girlfriend, then ruin it all through my own bitchy stubbornness? 

But I'll never get anywhere if I dwell on the what if. I think I just need to be patient.
