_Comfortable to the extreme._

Yes! Brand new bed, now with significantly less cat urine smell. It’s incredibly comfortable. I should have done this many moons ago.

I’ve been accused of being cheap, mega super cheap - and, while that has its benefits, it needs to have limits! I work hard enough and have a damn good job, so I need to be happy to throw funds at stuff to make my existence more… better. More comfortable!

I need to get around to paying someone to decorate and overhaul my house. I would trust the choices of someone with much better artistic flair than me. Based on my experience I just suck at choosing colours and styles.

_But I make a start!_

And work? Work is good. Lately it’s been a lot of scheduled projects and new installs. It’s kind of nice to know exactly what I’m doing the next day when I go to bed at night, rather than being at the whim of whatever machine happens to break down on any given day.

Having a company car is the best. It’s expressly allowed to be for personal use, without limits! In the pitch to me coming over to a full time employee my boss even said that if I want to joy ride around the country on a holiday, all my fuel and vehicle expenses are covered. I’m due for four new tyres, and all I have to do is drop the car off at the tyre shop for an hour.

And having a nice and comfortable car is very useful, because I do a lot of driving. I’ve had this Subaru Outback White Tiger since June 20, and I’ve put close to 35,000 kilometers on the clock, putting me over 2,000 kilometers a week on average! My job is driving, with a little bit of engineering in the middle.

And on that, [I've finally listed the old Green Mazda. Buy it! It’s a good deal.](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/807479799922396/) I don’t want to keep a personal car around, it’ll never get used and it’ll just deteriorate.

Finally, a good friend of mine has put a word into my head - neurotypical.

I’m not neurotypical, not at all! At my friend’s suggestion, I took a very in depth online quiz to try and evaluate better just where I sit on this spectrum. [Try it for yourself!](https://rdos.net/eng/Aspie-quiz.php)

I hate these labels.

_What a... horrible shape._

After taking this “Aspie Quiz”, It turns out I’m extremely Aspie and not very neurotypical - AKA normal. That little bump in the chart seems to indicate I swing most towards neurotypicality when it comes to relationships. That’s odd, I suck at relationships! But then again, I suspect it might just be optimistic and wishful thinking while I was taking the quiz. I’m not good at evaluating myself, no matter how hard I try to imagine how I come off from an observer's perspective.

Besides, all that damn relationship stuff is on the back burner. I just don’t have much of a desire for it, at least not right now. I’ve got friends, family and even work, and they all feel way more important to me.
