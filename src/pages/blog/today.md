I feel violently awful today and I don’t know why.

Nothing has really happened; just a bad day. Can you have one of those without any reason or causation?

I feel like drilling a hole in my head and pouring industrial strength bleach in to eat away at all the bad and defective parts and just leave a clean and functioning head behind.

I know a brain doesn’t work like that, it’s a metaphor.
