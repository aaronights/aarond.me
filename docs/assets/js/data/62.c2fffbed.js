I had to hurry home – my father is on some rather strong pain killers that can make him go a bit wonky before bed time.</p>\n<p>I was hungry. It was about 9:30 pm and I hadn’t eaten anything substantial that day except a milkshake. I opted for something different - I went to the famous <a href="http://www.carlsjr.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Carl’s Jr fast food restaurant</a>. There isn’t a Carl’s Jr near where I live so I very rarely have it, while I was nearby I thought I’d dive in.</p>\n<p>I went a little over the top and got a large chargrilled BBQ Chicken Sandwich combo. It was nice! The burger could have been a bit warmer, but I really liked the rather chunky fries. I didn’t have a huge amount of time to eat as I had to get home, so I got it all down fairly fast. After I was done I jumped in my car and started the 40 minute drive home.</p>\n<p><a href="/assets/static/src/media/images/blog/IMG_20171119_000216_281.jpg"><img class="g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill=\'none\' viewBox=\'0 0 1920 1920\' xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' xmlns:xlink=\'http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id=\'__svg-blur-15\'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in=\'SourceGraphic\' stdDeviation=\'40\'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x=\'0\' y=\'0\' filter=\'url(%23__svg-blur-15)\' width=\'1920\' height=\'1920\' xlink:href=\'data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCABAAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAABgcDBAUIAQL/xAA3EAABAwIEBQIEAwcFAAAAAAABAgMEBREABhIhBxMxQVEUgSIyYXEVQpEXIzNSscHhYnKCodH/xAAZAQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAwQFAAH/xAAkEQACAgEEAgEFAAAAAAAAAAABAgADEQQSEyEiMVEFFEFxof/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AE2%2bIaYOcI8KaGlUpDhbkulBvYjqPok2Pk2w0aTNp1ep7q6TKakxgkpCwSNJ%2boOEZ%2bzCtLUHqhMp8Rom6nHHirf2G5wz%2bE9DeylT6khS0y/UvJVzmkEIKAm1hq3vc%2bLYFGVAATOspcnOO4USGVRKjEkMpLaSvQr/SSNvYkDF6uRWpTUectSkpCNSki3UHc/2t4OK7S3%2bSqIhpK2UgG6vi3vfbxv2HjE61qepiY7h0Ng2JWLG4/Ta/64BtXU/hO%2bztUbzj9ZkMxr0lJeltPJTH9Ita1C%2bnQkhYBJv2BHvgD4MLqdfquYcwSyj1UpbbIV2bSkXAH0A0i30xY4nVGZRcvS4UdXqIEtbYVzgRdB3VpKbfCTbbsLebYJuBcD0%2bQ4jxbShct1x86fGrSP8ApOHMoI2xIbHcY1GgMwA2pA1Oi13Fdf8AGNGu01Ex5ciPYPKAVbsrb%2buM6ozYtOgOyJ7wZjoSVKVuTYdbAbnA4zxbyy0thL/rmYywAiQuOdBHnYk29sTPptO1fAwAEoS28tyrkmCVLpCHqkl2WS47YHnqcso37C%2bw%2bwtgkjNpQlCHCotA3ISQCr/33wLTKrEpkZTsqShtIIFlKvq%2bw7nAvJ4mpVNbix2FMoWNn1jVftskf3xF5H3Lt27pYxqrUItPbDjriI5KgEgm%2b/jycYUpuXVHA5O1pQDrabtYC3QnycU6Z%2bFVdlSXZIlPLBu47sr/AB7Y24bLEGM0wtxTiU7JJVdRFvOEPZ149SqqoKcv2ZFm6dT6rlOc3V3WozDiA0u1lOIWDcFKfNxt2wTR3oWTsksuoDjrUKKhttokaibCwNuhJO5woeIzEKVMpseS6gOqUNSS2XCkE2uEggk/1xpzKdmrLtLcg1acmZSX5YioaW0dS0aOYHULO4G1rK3B2xr1Ws9O8%2b5j30rXfsHqF1PkyKxTa89Lc5j70dQSPyoBTsEjsMD0Skw5nDeO5LbWvkJ0q5Y%2bIbjcfY42sgrDtMmkHdLamzfyBbH1QCImXDF0pXqcVcE2%2bG9zYd7A4xyxz2fmaKgAHHyIopqKdKlkoTUqi7fdxKjp%2bwPb2xAcvtLk81UZTMdJuULfUT/tNsZqc0ISrcLDY7pNji3EfqtXUBCjOLvvdR0j774uFbHoRYWqseR/siVTkwnz6CY4w7q%2bYKJRf37Y1qRnR11DsXmIVMYBCFk2Q4R4vjPjUWqVh9xmAy/UHW18pwRhoZbV4U6qwJ%2bicMeVlil5UoLcSBFoT1bklK5MmpPt8uPYdUIWST9Nj3J8YcNDyL5wG%2boKjDZ6gCzV57lSptRcmQfxGI4HSpawAVJNwNPQjBTXM2zalFYDdPpzOh5cpXpppu6pSCk3ClHbofbEOen6ZW49Gp2XozNWzI2kmZJpUQpbWLWtZIAO/e23vbGrE4RuxabDkViRVFTJq0oEWnxQ6I9%2b7ilEAAd/0F8WJSqpx/iQ23l35PRmxw4qMZFDeddSmNdpVmlO8wkJv%2bY9ScBeZqs%2bpEWLSKbLHpn%2beJSnFKUq%2b5QkAWCe19ztgjY4XzFKqdHh5lirMMfwkR1HSFXIStd/hJ3%2bEXsN8CtX4czqflV%2bvtVWnzGo6tLzccqISQoJUErtZRBPbbwcIq0YDFnhPqegEMWiUohMh11fLT5G5P0GDnhtnKlNvSIVRS9EkziWhUOclIZbCdtz8pvc38keMKefNdmva3NgPlSOiRjxvoL2w5Bt7nXHeMTpGimnUpmoZukOqNBhN8mjx/lSEWsVpT3UtVwFHci574GOG8RWa80VTM2aY7DtJQ2tb7khN2tRtpSknskDt0sPOBFniVmEwm4j5p0iM2EhDb8JtaU2FhYWtsMUa7m%2buV5hEeozSYiLaYzSA00P%2bKQB%2buHbhJQhEkVMMeqSF0t59iK46QkIcKSWtd0hVjvtbrjoLifnam0diNVKTUETKuqMqPFSy7raj3N1PKANiq1gkH645kQ4TYdsH0Sr5fi5VozaKcHqkzKL05TyLc0A3ShKwflt1FseAw2Ge4zJ7zuSeDKEPrtXa%2bv96txXxanBdRJP8qNvurBjNyoheX8vZeaa5lEjkPzHGyLOBtOoIHnWsk7dhhAcRs8yM7T4bsmMmGyw0UNMoUVgkm6lbjvYD2xTypm2sZUEtVKkoQJDXKVzEa9Pgpv0OCBgFTP/2Q==\' /%3e%3c/svg%3e" width="1920" alt="I was so excited, I even took a snap!" data-srcset="/assets/static/IMG_20171119_000216_281.82a2fbd.3434b57.jpg 480w, /assets/static/IMG_20171119_000216_281.cbab2cf.3434b57.jpg 1024w, /assets/static/IMG_20171119_000216_281.2665e34.3434b57.jpg 1920w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" data-src="/assets/static/IMG_20171119_000216_281.2665e34.3434b57.jpg"><noscript><img class="g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loaded" src="/assets/static/IMG_20171119_000216_281.2665e34.3434b57.jpg" width="1920" alt="I was so excited, I even took a snap!"></noscript></a>\n<em>I was so excited, I even took a snap!</em></p>\n<p>Ugh. After about five minutes I started to feel rather unwell. My gut was squealing, I was nauseous and my head started to throb.</p>\n<p>I kept driving, trying to move my head as little as possible. It got worse. My insides started to feel like a volcano about to burst and my head felt like it was being crushed by a bus. Driving became a challenge.</p>\n<p>About five minutes away from home, it happened. I thought I was holding it down OK, but without any warning I vomited all over the dash, steering wheel, my pants and the floor. It happened so fast, I started to pull over but then just figured I might as well continue home while sitting in my own sick.</p>\n<p>I got through the front door and managed to get all my clothes into the washing machine without getting any mess over the carpet. I then had a fun time sitting on the floor with a bucket for the next hour, hurling multiple times until every bit of that large BBQ Chicken Sandwich was out of me.</p>\n<p>Once I was fairly sure I’d finished with the vomiting, I took a higher than recommended amount of Paracetamol and Ibuprofen then sat in a hot bath full of bubbles until I started to feel a bit normal again.</p>\n<p>But this morning I woke up feeling fine, like the whole thing never happened. Plus I don’t have to digest all that high fat and salt food!</p>\n<p>So, the lesson from this? Avoid lukewarm chicken! Especially from anyone whose father is named Carl.</p>\n<p>Got experience with hurling after chicken?
