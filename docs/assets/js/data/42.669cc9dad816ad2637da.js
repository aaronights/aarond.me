I was apprehensive at first, but it ended up being very enjoyable. I got to have great conversations with intelligent people.</p>\n<p>In this process I was asked if I would be interested in giving a presentation at the next meeting, discussing my story. I wasn’t sure if I’d be up to it, but for the past month I’ve been writing a presentation. And after using every bit of drive I could muster, it’s actually happening.</p>\n<p><a href="http://humanist.nz/event/leaving-the-faith-of-a-family-behind/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">You can see all the details here at the Humanist Society of New Zealand events page.</a></p>\n<p>The outline is this: <em>Aaron Davies, born into and raised in the Jehovah’s Witness religion for 25 years, will be talking about his path out from the religious organisation. He will be discussing what compelled him to make such a big change in his life, focusing on the overwhelming evidence for biological evolution without theistic intervention.</em></p>\n<p><em>Other points of discussion include: How is something determined to be a fact in a modern scientific world? Is living a life without a God less satisfying and fulfilling? Is hope a beneficial trait to have and what factor does it play in decision making? What are the consequences for leaving such a powerful religion behind, and what effect does it have on mental health?</em></p>\n<p><strong>6:30pm, Monday June 12. <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/maps/place/Thistle+Inn/@-41.277766,174.779681,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa3f878dc4c208b97!8m2!3d-41.277766!4d174.779681" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">At the Thistle Inn, right by Parliament and the main Railway Station in New Zealand’s capital city Wellington.</a></strong></p>\n<p>This blog doesn’t get many readers, I’m sure none of them are even in this country.
