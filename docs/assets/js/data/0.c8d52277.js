This is both horrific and embarrassing, especially considering the ideal Star Trek represents - inclusivity.</em></p>\n<p><em>Attacking anyone online for a TV show is never acceptable. I’m extremely frustrated and even upset about the direction Star Trek Discovery is taking in regards to continuity, but it is absolutely not grounds for abusive and hurtful interactions on social media. Many people are enjoying Discovery, and they are entitled to share how much they are enjoying it without encountering hate. I do hope Star Trek can return to be more inline with what came before, but no one is entitled to have that happen.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I’m into Star Trek way too much.

You run a platform for 10 years, encourage people to use it under hopes of getting featured on the front page and even getting commissioned work from it and after all that you call it just a “little experiment”? That feels like a way to skirt all archival responsibility and belittle the extensive work that a sizeable number of your readers contributed.
