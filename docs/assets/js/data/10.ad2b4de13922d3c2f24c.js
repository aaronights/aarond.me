I have a few thoughts on this topic that I\'d like to share with my 33 intimate followers here on MyIGN!</p>\n<div class="youtube">\n\t<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xsbfJgp1eU?start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><em>Video discussion: The ESRB and violence in games</em></p>\n<p>I\'m not from the United States. Here in New Zealand our classification system, the OFLC, is radically different from the ESRB. Video games use the same rating scale as film and television. Here games like Call of Duty get a bright red R18+ rating - the highest rating for any explicit content, including pornography. And since there is no constitution to amend, these games are legally restricted for sale to people over 18 years of age. But even with this, Call of Duty is just as popular as in the US. Having the bold red sticker on it doesn\'t completely destroy sales or reputation, as some people have said might happen in this scenario.</p>\n<p>And on that, why is violence more acceptable than sex? Why is the act of calculated and bloody murder more acceptable than consensual intercourse? The most violent of games can work magic to get a M rating, but the smallest showing of sexual content almost always gets blocked for fear of an AO rating. Isn\'t this… strange? Mature people will happily have sex. In the current era sexual promiscuity is more open than ever. But murder? One of the worst things a person can do and is also extremely illegal.</p>\n<p>The ESRB rating system is somewhat perplexing. Teen is for Teenagers, but where does that end? Is a T rated game for 13 year old people, or 19? Somewhat worse is Mature. Where does maturity start? I get the impression that the Mature rating is crafted to be a sliding scale - not designed for a specific age, but a mindset. I know some 15 year old kids with more maturity than most 22 year olds, and the same with the other extreme. And the most clear rating - Adults Only - is outright not used. Right now everyone from stores to publishers refuse to carry games with this rating, leaving it exclusively on a few obscure PC titles.</p>\n<p><em> What are your thoughts, are you happy with the ESRB system?
