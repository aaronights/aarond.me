It was fun, the game was very well played and the underdogs came out on top. After that was over it turned into being like a nomad, moving from place to place in search of something better.</p>\n<p>Every location was incredibly loud. The later things got the tipsier and rowdier people were. The night ended up in some very… interesting places. It was almost cliché, just the kind of night out you’d expect from a sitcom (with incredibly dull writing).</p>\n<p>I spent most of the night fighting not to fall into a panic attack. At times I wanted to slip into the fetal position and wait for something to crush me flat. On the plus side I discovered how good of a bluff I could pull. I knew I had to do this, just because of the going outside of the comfort zone thing. I forced myself to do things and go places that a few years ago would have made me hurl.</p>\n<p>Do people enjoy this? I mean, really? Is this the thing that most people want to do for fun? It seems absurd! What the hell do people get out of it? It’s nothing, it’s empty. Any conversations or companionship is just a slurred yelling match; any entertainment is crude and uncompelling.</p>\n<p>Near the end of the night we walked past a large used bookshop. I should try more things once, but in the future given the choice I’d pick that room full of litreature every time.</p>\n<p>I know how bad that sounds, it probably does make me very strange. In case you haven’t noticed I just don’t care anymore. It does limit my options for any kind of social life, but I’ve stopped caring about that too. If quiet introverts had a club it’d stop them being quiet introverts.</p>\n",date:"2017-06-30T12:00:00+12:00",timeToRead:1}}}}}]);
