I get told I do an important job and do it well, but I still feel sharply pathetic revealing what I do. Saying to someone that I look after an elderly man in a small, dead town isn’t very attractive. \x3c!-- more --\x3e</p>\n<p><a href="/media/images/blog/AtTheBog.jpg"><img src="/media/images/blog/AtTheBog.jpg" alt="At the Beach."></a>\n<em>Hey! It was overcast and windy.</em></p>\n<p>But like I said before, <a href="/blog/2018/12/02/a-little-help-from-my-friends">I get by with a little help from my friends.</a> Having a circle of friends has become important to me. Crazy, I know! I manage to organize things so I seem to get away every other weekend, doing things from LAN-ing up for some vintage Halp to going to a pub.</p>\n<p>I’m still extremely awkward, but dating is more fun than hard. It’s still not an overly frequent event, though. I have pity for <a href="/blog/2017/04/11/dating-is-hard-and-i-am-very-awkward">the version of me from years ago when that first “personal” entry was posted.</a> I don’t get nervous for most things in life now, plus I’ve learned the fine art of shutting the hell up and listening rather than raving on.</p>\n<p>Some of the time at least.</p>\n<p>I am gaming much more. I picked up an Xbox One and opted to go all digital with games. Right now it’s showing 204 games installed, that many physical discs would require a small shed! I’m not sure of the legitimacy of the various key trading websites I’ve been using to buy stuff, but I like to live dangerously. I’m also using the Game Pass subscription service Microsoft offers. Picking up 6 month extensions as they’ve come on sale has got me all loaded up until sometime late 2020. Remember when that felt like an unobtainable future?</p>\n<p><a href="/media/images/blog/XboxGameCount.jpg"><img src="/media/images/blog/XboxGameCount.jpg" alt="Too Many Games."></a>\n<em>The big number is daunting.</em></p>\n<p>A few highlights from the experience are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.snake-pass.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Snake Pass:</a> Very frustrating until you figure out how to actually progress, but it’s such a beautiful game with a neat approach to traversal.</li>\n<li><a href="https://sniperelite4.com/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sniper Elite 4:</a> Yes, it’s absolutely absurd. But it’s fun! Any bugs or annoying quirks from prior installments in the series have been ironed out. Testicle shots always cause me to wince.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.sega.com/games/sonic-forces" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sonic Forces:</a> An attempt to return to the tried and true method, after not being successful for a bit. It is the same Sonic Colours/Sonic Generations gameplay, oddly limited in scope despite attempts to put new features in like character creation. Not amazing, but I was still left wanting more. Maybe even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gc0169Ht48" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">One More Last First Bump.</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/halo-5-guardians/brrc2bp0g9p0?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Halo 5: Guardians:</a> Extremely strong mechanics, tuned almost too well.. The story got a bit… bogged down. The removal of split screen was unfortunate, largely because none of my friends are at all interested in an Xbox One. Would love to do a 4 player team to push through on Legendary difficulty, but alas.</li>\n<li><a href="https://forzamotorsport.net/en-us/games/fh4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Forza Horizon 4:</a> I was impressed by realising how much tech must be under the hood in order to have all these different vehicles handle so well in so many different environments. Racing isn’t a high priority, my biggest time sink is blindly exploring this little bit of fictional Britain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I still have things to get to! I really want to dive into Paper Mario: Color Splash on Wii U - having that and others in my backlog is somewhat holding me back from investing in a Switch.</p>\n<p>Sometime in the New Year, when the postal service starts to run again, I should have another budget review up. This time it’s for what I’d call the cheapest viable phone. It’s from a brand I’ve never heard of, but on paper it looks like a deal. I think I’m getting hooked to the thrill of the gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/kzwHs9PhJwY?t=99" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I take a chance, I roll the dice</a> and either get a great deal or dog shit.</p>\n<p>Could that be a metaphor for dating? Maybe, but it’s not very kind.</p>\n',date:"2018-12-30T00:00:00.000Z",timeToRead:3}}}}}]);
