In many Christian denominations this is based on so called prophecies that are claimed to have been made thousands of years ago. It is generally stated that mankind, growing distant from their deity, would just hit the fan.</p>\n<p>A common claim is this: We are living in horrific times full of hateful atrocities worse than any other time in history, and the only way out is through supernatural salvation by an all powerful deity.</p>\n<p>A tactic used is to then appeal to emotional decision making to reach a conclusion. Rather than presenting statistics or facts, rhetorical questions are asked about the status of humanity and the world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>“Have you noticed a general downward trend in people’s attitudes?”</em></li>\n<li><em>“Have you noticed that the world is becoming increasingly filled with violence?”</em></li>\n<li><em>“Have you noticed that major wars, famine, poverty, lawlessness and even a lack of love have become common place in modern life?”</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are all very big claims, and importantly they can be proven true or false with research and statistical information.</p>\n<h2 id="attitude"><a href="#attitude" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Attitude</h2>\n<p>This is a broad topic, tough to pin down to a specific metric.

Since the end of World War Two, the absolute number of people that are dying as a result of warfare has declined. The proportion of people that die in wars is lower than any historical engagement. Many nations in the world used to have raging internal conflicts - from the land wars here in New Zealand, civil war in the Americas and tribal warfare sweeping across the African continent. Nations are working together without bloodshed and violence. War is still a problem in the 21st century, but it may very well be at its lowest point in human history.</p>\n<p><em>"Violence has been in decline over long stretches of time"</em>, says Harvard professor Steven Pinker, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/slides/war-and-violence/#/5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>"and we may be living in the most peaceful time in our species\' existence."</em></a></p>\n<p>Even more than a decline in bad things, there is so many advantages to living today. In every nation on earth life expectancy is at a record high and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">still going higher.</a> Child mortality is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">getting better.</a> Horrendous diseases like Polio are on the decline and may almost be <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/polio/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">eradicated in the next decade.</a> The number of people smoking <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smoking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">is decreasing.</a> Healthcare is far better and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">more people have access to it now than ever before.</a> More people are literate and are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">getting an education.</a></p>\n<p>Politics is a hostile issue that seems to dominate the headlines. The United States has a President that is reaching all time lows in so many areas. But people are speaking up and criticising! They are openly challenging and fighting what could be the most powerful man on the planet. It was barely a few centuries ago that speaking out against a King, Emperor or other powerful leader could result in torture or death.</p>\n<p>We are not there. Humanity still has such a long way to go to! While so many things are better now than ever, it doesn’t mean we have reached the ultimate goal state of these things. Plus, we face issues around climate change, substance abuse and sexual bigotry.</p>\n<p>But we are getting there. If someone states that the world has become a horrible and loveless place, insist they back it up with facts and statistics.</p>\n<p>What is it like now, and when in history was it any better?</p>\n',date:"2017-12-20T13:00:00+13:00",timeToRead:43}}}}}]);
