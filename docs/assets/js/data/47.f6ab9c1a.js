I thought having an empty white space in the middle would be good for writing a note or message, but the intent isn’t clear.</p>\n<p>I combined information and humour by using sentences written in the third person rather than just a list of details. It’s not just a name, occupation and website listed - it’s a narrative about my name, occupation and website!</p>\n<p>I put down that I’m a writer, but I am very open to expanding into other areas of work. Anyone that takes the effort to visit the listed website will quickly grasp my vast area of expertise.</p>\n<p>Yes, that is the top part of my hair backed by a clear winter’s sky on the left. I did try out having a photo of my face, but I don’t think highly enough of my appearance to have it printed a thousand times over. I wanted to have something unique beyond just a nice template. The intent is the patch of jet black hair will intrigue people; make them want to find out what it actually is.

Having a QR code printed squarely in the middle was boring. This way it’s instructive without instructions.

I’ve got enough to hand these out to everyone I speak to in a year.</p>\n<p>Is meeting a girl and handing her your business card a bit too audacious? It might be simpler than writing down or sharing a number, but can give the impression that I’ve got an ego the size of the sun.</p>\n<p><div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 0;"><div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 25px; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WGOohBytKTU"></iframe></div></div></p>\n<p>But when I’m seeking business time it might be appropriate to make it rain with business cards.</p>\n',date:"2017-06-25T00:00:00.000Z",timeToRead:1}}}}}]);
