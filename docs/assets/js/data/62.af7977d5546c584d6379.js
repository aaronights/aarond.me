I had to hurry home – my father is on some rather strong pain killers that can make him go a bit wonky before bed time.</p>\n<p>I was hungry. It was about 9:30 pm and I hadn’t eaten anything substantial that day except a milkshake. I opted for something different - I went to the famous <a href="http://www.carlsjr.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Carl’s Jr fast food restaurant</a>. There isn’t a Carl’s Jr near where I live so I very rarely have it, while I was nearby I thought I’d dive in.</p>\n<p>I went a little over the top and got a large chargrilled BBQ Chicken Sandwich combo. It was nice! The burger could have been a bit warmer, but I really liked the rather chunky fries. I didn’t have a huge amount of time to eat as I had to get home, so I got it all down fairly fast. After I was done I jumped in my car and started the 40 minute drive home.</p>\n<p><a href="/assets/static/src/media/images/blog/IMG_20171119_000216_281.jpg"><img class="g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill=\'none\' viewBox=\'0 0 1920 1920\' xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' xmlns:xlink=\'http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id=\'__svg-blur-63\'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in=\'SourceGraphic\' stdDeviation=\'40\'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x=\'0\' y=\'0\' filter=\'url(%23__svg-blur-63)\' width=\'1920\' height=\'1920\' xlink:href=\'data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCABAAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAABgcDBAUIAgH/xAA3EAABAwIEBQMDAgILAAAAAAABAgMEBREABhIhBxMxQVEUYYEiMnEVkcHhFyMzQlJicoKhsdH/xAAZAQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAwQFAAH/xAAkEQACAgEEAgEFAAAAAAAAAAABAgADEQQSEyEiMVEFFEFxof/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AE2%2bIaYOcI8OaGlUpDhbkulBvYjqPZJsfJtho0mbTq9T3V0iU1JjBBSFgkaSNtwcI3%2bjCtLUHqhMp8Rom6nHHirf4G5wzuE9DeylT6khTiZfqXkq5zSCElATaw1b3ufFsCjKgAJnWUuxzjuFEllUSoxJDKS2kr0K/ykjb4JAxerkVmUzHnLUpKQjUpIt1B3P8LeDiBlb/ACVRENJWykA3V9W977eN%2bwxMpSnqYmO4dDYNiVixuP22v%2b%2bAbV1P4TvsrVG84/WZDMa9LSXpjTyUx/SLWtQvp0JIWATv2BHzgD4MLqdfqmYcwSyj1UpbbIV0DaUi4A9gCkW9sWOJ1RmUbLsuEwr1MCWtsK54Iug7q0lNvpJtt2FvNsE3AuByMhxHi2lC5brj5CfGrSP%2bE4cygjbEq2O4x6PAZgBtSBqdFruK6/yxoV2momPLkRwA8oBXsrb/ALxnVKbFp1Pdkz3gzHQkqUrcmw62A3OBxni3lppbCX/XMxlgBEhcc6CPOxJt8YmfTadq%2bBgAJQlt5blXJMEaXSEPVJLso8x2wPPUuyjfsL7D8C2CWM2lCUIcKi0DchJAKv8A35wLTKrEpkZTsqShpIIFlKvq/A7nAxJ4mpVNRFjsFlCxs%2bsar9tkj%2bOIvI%2b5du3dLGLVajEp7YcdcRHJUAkE338ecYUpqXVHA5O1pQDrabtYC3RR8nFOmfpNXZUl2SJTywbuO7K/l8Y24bLEGM0wtxbiU7JJVqURbzhD2dePUqqqCnL9mRZunU%2bqZTnN1d1uNHcQGl2spxCwoEFKfNxt2wSxnoWT8ksuoDjrUKK2221caibCwNuhJO5wouIzEKVMpseS6gOqVZSS2XCkE21BIIJPt3xpzKdmrLtLcg1aciXSX5YioaW0dS0aOYHULO4G1rK3B2xr1Ws9O8%2b5j30rXdsX1C6nyZFYp1eelucx96OoJH91AKdkpHYYHolJhzOG8dyW2tQYTpVyx9Q3G4/BxtZBWHaZNIO6W1Nm/kC2PVAIiZcMXSlet1VwTb6b3Nh3sDjHLHPZ%2bZoqAAcfIiimop0qWShNSqLt93EqOn8A9vjEBy%2b0uSXVRlMxwblC31E/6TbGajNKUq3Cw2O6TY/jFuI/VawoCFGcXfcFR0j874uFbHoRYWqseR/siVTkwnz6CY4w7f7golF/ntjWpGc3XUOxeYhUxgKCFkkIcI7i%2bM%2bLRKpWH3GYDT891tfKcEcaGW1eFOqsCfZOGNKyvS8qUNuJT4tCerckpXJk1J9sNx7DqhDhJPtse5PjDhoeRfOC31BUYBPUAmavUHKlTai5Ng/qMRwOlS1gAqSbgW6EYKK3mybUorAbp1OZ0PLlK9NON3VKQUm%2bpR26H4xFnl6mVxmj03L0VmrZjbSTMk0qIUtrFrWskAHe29tvm2NWLwidi02FIq8iqKmTVpR6WnxQ6I9%2b7iiQAB3/AGF8WJSqpx/iQW3l35PRmxw4qMZFDeddSmNdpVmlu8wkJvuVHqTgLzNVX1JixaRTZYEZ/niUpxSlKvuUJAFgntfc7YJWOF8tS6nRoeZoqzDT/ZojqOkKuQla7/STv9IvYb4FKxw5m0/Kr9faq1PmNx1aXm45UQkhQSoJX0UQT2%2bMIq0YDFnhPqegEMWaUphMh11fLT56k%2bwwc8Ns5Upt6TCqKXokmeS0KhzkpSy2E7bn7Te5v5I8YU9QmuzXtbmwH2pHRIx8b6C9sOQbe51x3jE6Qohp1KZn5tkOqNBgt8mjx/tSEWsVpT3UtVwFHci5PXAzw3iKzXmmqZmzTHYdpKG1rfckpu1c20pST2SB26WHnAizxKzCYTcR806RGbCQhp%2bC2tKbCwsLW2GKNdzfXK8whiozSYiLaYzSA00P9iQB%2b%2bHbhJQhE9qmGPU5C6W8%2bxEcdISEOFJLWu6Qqx32t1x0HxPztTaOxFqlJqCJlXVGVHiJZd1tR7m6nlAGxVawSD745kQ4TYdsH8Sr5fi5VoyEU5L1RZlF6cp5FuaAboQlYP226i2PAYbDPcZc957JHBlCH3CK7X1/1q3FfVqcF1Ek/wCFG35Vgwm5UQvL%2bXsvMtcyiRyl%2bY42RZwNp1BA861knbsMIHiNnmTnefDdkxkw2WGihplCisEk3Urcd7AfGKeVc21jKglqpUpCBIa5SuYjXp8FIPQ4IGAVM//Z\' /%3e%3c/svg%3e" width="1920" alt="I was so excited, I even took a snap!" data-srcset="/assets/static/IMG_20171119_000216_281-w480.3434b57b97180d70cdb27249c936a3d8.jpg 480w, /assets/static/IMG_20171119_000216_281-w1024.3434b57b97180d70cdb27249c936a3d8.jpg 1024w, /assets/static/IMG_20171119_000216_281-w1920.3434b57b97180d70cdb27249c936a3d8.jpg 1920w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" data-src="/assets/static/IMG_20171119_000216_281-w1920.3434b57b97180d70cdb27249c936a3d8.jpg"><noscript><img class="g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loaded" src="/assets/static/IMG_20171119_000216_281-w1920.3434b57b97180d70cdb27249c936a3d8.jpg" width="1920" alt="I was so excited, I even took a snap!"></noscript></a>\n<em>I was so excited, I even took a snap!</em></p>\n<p>Ugh. After about five minutes I started to feel rather unwell. My gut was squealing, I was nauseous and my head started to throb.</p>\n<p>I kept driving, trying to move my head as little as possible. It got worse. My insides started to feel like a volcano about to burst and my head felt like it was being crushed by a bus. Driving became a challenge.</p>\n<p>About five minutes away from home, it happened. I thought I was holding it down OK, but without any warning I vomited all over the dash, steering wheel, my pants and the floor. It happened so fast, I started to pull over but then just figured I might as well continue home while sitting in my own sick.</p>\n<p>I got through the front door and managed to get all my clothes into the washing machine without getting any mess over the carpet. I then had a fun time sitting on the floor with a bucket for the next hour, hurling multiple times until every bit of that large BBQ Chicken Sandwich was out of me.</p>\n<p>Once I was fairly sure I’d finished with the vomiting, I took a higher than recommended amount of Paracetamol and Ibuprofen then sat in a hot bath full of bubbles until I started to feel a bit normal again.</p>\n<p>But this morning I woke up feeling fine, like the whole thing never happened. Plus I don’t have to digest all that high fat and salt food!</p>\n<p>So, the lesson from this? Avoid lukewarm chicken! Especially from anyone whose father is named Carl.</p>\n<p>Got experience with hurling after chicken?
