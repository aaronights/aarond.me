These exams are not free: $184 in local (NZ) currency.

Narratively it is stated to be the same NCC-1701 ship from the original series, but many aspects of the new design are inconsistent with the original. The size, shape and basic layout reference the original but have been modified, putting it at odds with the recognizable ship's form people have come to love from Star Trek: The Original Series.</p>\n","date":"2019-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":5}},{"node":{"title":"Sugar Free Cola Challenge","image":"/media/images/blog/coke.jpg","path":"/blog/2019/04/01/sugar-free-cola-challenge/","excerpt":"<p>My quest for finding and reviewing the cheapest products possible has taken an interesting turn. This time I roped in a group of friends to tackle a twist on the Pepsi challenge - testing an array of sugar free cola beverages, seeing what comes out on top and if the no-name brands can stand up to the titans.</p>\n<p>The motivation for this challenge was my friend Mark's proclamation that Diet Coke is his drink of choice and, while some other options are bearable, nothing beats the original. It's 95% of his beverage consumption - outside of exorbitant craft beer, at least.

There isn't any middle ground, if I enjoy something I want it all. I want to deep dive into every little thing about it. On the other hand, if something doesn't grab me I can't half like it. Sitting on fences is just too uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>I grew up very awkwardly. School wasn't fun, I was bullied and could never fit into any social circles. I left high school prematurely, and a few months after that I got admitted to professional help. Doing that ended up with me being diagnosed as having high functioning autism, also called Asperger syndrome.</p>\n<p>It's not a label I like to give myself. I don't want people to make assumptions about who I am based on a flaw in how my brain is wired, but I know it'll help to make sense of how I behave and think in this context. &#x3C;</p>\n","date":"2019-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":4}}]}},"context":{}}
