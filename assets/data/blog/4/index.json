It was the real deal! Extra large tents, barbeques, mosquitoes - the works. There might have been a plug to charge a phone, but that'd be about it. Hipsters could call it a digital detox. The idea of a whole week without screens, games and lines of code made him shiver.</p>\n","date":"2019-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":3}},{"node":{"title":"Brains!","image":"","path":"/blog/2019/01/02/brains/","excerpt":"<p>This won't make sense, but I'm trying here.</p>\n","date":"2019-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":3}},{"node":{"title":"Up, up, up!

And it was a task! IGN really didn't care about helping people keep their content from the ”little My IGN blogging experiment.\"</p>\n<p>Side note: Really? You run a platform for 10 years, encourage people to use it under hopes of getting featured on the front page and even getting commissioned work from it and after all that you call it just a “little experiment”? That feels like a way to skirt all archival responsibility and belittle the extensive work that a sizeable number of your readers contributed.

This relatively small amount of consumers can lead to a lack of product variety in some areas. Out side of the known brands – Samsung to Sony, Panasonic to Philips – there isn't much of a choice when it comes to low cost consumer electronics. There is just one exception I'm aware of to this, a store brand owned by the biggest department store chain in the country: <a href=\"https://www.thewarehouse.co.nz/c/electronics-gaming/tvs-accessories-/televisions#prefn1=brandCode&#x26;prefv1=Veon\">Veon Televisions by The Warehouse</a>. &#x3C;</p>\n","date":"2018-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":7}},{"node":{"title":"Human life is better now than it ever has been","image":"/media/images/blog/share-of-people-who-say-they-are-happy.png","path":"/blog/2017/12/20/human-life-is-better-now-than-it-ever-has-been/","excerpt":"<p>A common claim made by some religious doctrines is that the world is in an awful state, and that humanity is deteriorating.
