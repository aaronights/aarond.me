And it was a task! IGN really didn't care about helping people keep their content from the ”little My IGN blogging experiment.\"</p>\n<p>Side note: Really? You run a platform for 10 years, encourage people to use it under hopes of getting featured on the front page and even getting commissioned work from it and after all that you call it just a “little experiment”? That feels like a way to skirt all archival responsibility and belittle the extensive work that a sizeable number of your readers contributed. Thanks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeerIGN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Peer</a>. <!-- more --></p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/thanksign.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/thanksign.jpg\" alt=\"Thanks IGN.\"></a>\n<em>I edited the ads out. The last laugh is mine!.</em></p>\n<p>Looking back through what I've posted over those years can be rather embarrassing, but I'm not about to hide from that. <a href=\"https://mark.honeychurch.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mark, my handsome and talented friend</a> that helped me move over all my past content, couldn't help but fix a few dozen spelling and grammar errors. He's like that.</p>\n<p>I'm using the brand new blogging software <a href=\"https://gridsome.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gridsome</a> to run this place. It's a neat concept - rather than hosting a active server running PHP, the entire site is processed and generated offline before being deployed and hosted as a fully static website. It relies on most client side browsers having more than enough horsepower to render anything somewhat fancy. It gives me a sleek and clean result, plus it makes hosting both cheaper and faster. Gridsome is still new and in development, so as new features become available I'll aim to implement them.</p>\n<p>The first new thing I put up was <a href=\"/blog/2018/11/28/veon-4-k-tv-review\">a review of my new 4K TV</a>. Ever seen ultra cheap consumer electronics with an obscure brand name and wondered - what's the catch? I took the plunge so you don't have to! Spoilers: It's kind of a good deal! If you know what you're doing and don't want anything fancy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/howmeta.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/howmeta.jpg\" alt=\"How Meta.\"></a>\n<em>I'm that guy using a 50 inch TV as a monitor. Hey! It works.</em></p>\n<p>As for me, I'm still living in a small town being caregiver to my father. It's not the most exciting thing, but I get by. I have a few side projects going on! I try to get out as much as I can, but as you might expect my primary occupation does make that difficult.</p>\n<p>No comment system is running here (yet!), so hit me up on Twitter if you'd like to get in touch - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@aaronights</a>.
