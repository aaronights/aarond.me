Of course you have! </p>\n<p>When I talk about my job I have a tendency to rave about the amount of driving I do. It’s epic! For work I cover an area from Ohakune to Otaki. A while ago now, I transitioned from being a contractor to a bona fide full time employee. As part of that, I switched from using my personal car to being provided with a company car.</p>\n<p>I named her White Tiger! Please don’t laugh at the name, I thought it was cool.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/whitetiger.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/whitetiger.jpg\" alt=\"levin.\"></a>\n<em>I've spent a lot of time in this car.</em></p>\n<p>When signing all the forms for being a full time employee, I did attempt to negotiate for a better salary. I thought what I was being offered was rather… low ball. I wasn’t successful here, but as a consolation I was sold on the additional perks of the job. One of these was being able to use the provided company car for full personal use. This was great! I could get rid of my current car and all the expenses that go along with it. White Tiger here would be perfect for everything - supermarket runs, sober driving friends around and taking a certain awesome nephew out and about.</p>\n<p>This specific perk was sold to me rather hard. After thinking about it, I thought it was a good deal. Cars are expensive things to run, so not having to do that would almost kind of equal a bit of a pay boost.</p>\n<p>But now that’s all up for change.</p>\n<p>My work is forcing through a switch from Wagon style vehicles to giant, ugly, two seater Diesel Vans.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/freecandy.jpeg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/freecandy.jpeg\" alt=\"levin.\"></a>\n<em>Not exactly accurate, but very close.</em></p>\n<p>I don’t want this. All these benefits for personal use are gone. </p>\n<p>I also mega, super duper very much do not want to do the job I do now in a giant van. Every single working day I drive over some of the worst roads, and doing that in a front wheel drive Diesel tank would make my working life much less bearable.</p>\n<p>I work flipping hard at my job! It’s extremely demanding with very long hours. My family tells me all the time that I work far too much. I think I push myself hard  due to a combination of enjoying the work and being a bit… loyal to my employer. This change in vehicles really feels like a slap in the face to that loyalty. There was no consultation or negotiation at all, it was just forced upon us. </p>\n<p>It’s especially sleazy given my employers constant lip service to being environmentally friendly. All EV’s by 2030! But we are switching from hybrids to these toxic trucks for now.</p>\n<p>I thought I was good at my job. Well, at least some people tell me that I am. </p>\n","date":"2022-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":2,"belongsTo":{"edges":[]}}},"context":{}}
