Narratively it is stated to be the same NCC-1701 ship from the original series, but many aspects of the new design are inconsistent with the original. The size, shape and basic layout reference the original but have been modified, putting it at odds with the recognizable ship's form people have come to love from Star Trek: The Original Series.</p>\n","date":"2019-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":5}},{"node":{"title":"Sugar Free Cola Challenge","image":"/media/images/blog/coke.jpg","path":"/blog/2019/04/01/sugar-free-cola-challenge/","excerpt":"<p>My quest for finding and reviewing the cheapest products possible has taken an interesting turn. This time I roped in a group of friends to tackle a twist on the Pepsi challenge - testing an array of sugar free cola beverages, seeing what comes out on top and if the no-name brands can stand up to the titans.</p>\n<p>The motivation for this challenge was my friend Mark's proclamation that Diet Coke is his drink of choice and, while some other options are bearable, nothing beats the original. It's 95% of his beverage consumption - outside of exorbitant craft beer, at least. He put his pre-game odds of spotting the Diet Coke at 75% - very modest for the enthusiast he is. &#x3C;</p>\n","date":"2019-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":2}},{"node":{"title":"The Nature of my Obsession","image":"/media/images/blog/smoothhead.jpg","path":"/blog/2019/03/16/the-nature-of-my-obsession/","excerpt":"<p>My whole life I've been obsessive. There isn't any middle ground, if I enjoy something I want it all. I want to deep dive into every little thing about it. On the other hand, if something doesn't grab me I can't half like it. Sitting on fences is just too uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>I grew up very awkwardly. School wasn't fun, I was bullied and could never fit into any social circles. I left high school prematurely, and a few months after that I got admitted to professional help. Doing that ended up with me being diagnosed as having high functioning autism, also called Asperger syndrome.</p>\n<p>It's not a label I like to give myself. I don't want people to make assumptions about who I am based on a flaw in how my brain is wired, but I know it'll help to make sense of how I behave and think in this context. &#x3C;</p>\n","date":"2019-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":4}},{"node":{"title":"The Trouble with Star Trek Discovery","image":"/media/images/blog/st4.jpg","path":"/blog/2019/02/27/the-trouble-with-star-trek-discovery/","excerpt":"<p><em>Update 13 March 2019:  Certain people are using the discussion around Star Trek Discovery to promote bigoted ideas and openly attack actors and other people involved with the show. This is both horrific and embarrassing, especially considering the ideal Star Trek represents - inclusivity.</em></p>\n<p><em>Attacking anyone online for a TV show is never acceptable. I'm extremely frustrated and even upset about the direction Star Trek Discovery is taking in regards to continuity, but it is absolutely not grounds for abusive and hurtful interactions on social media. Many people are enjoying Discovery, and they are entitled to share how much they are enjoying it without encountering hate. I do hope Star Trek can return to be more inline with what came before, but no one is entitled to have that happen.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'm into Star Trek way too much.

The closest thing was putting 50 hours into Oblivion over a decade ago. I have owned Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 (via Xbox Game Pass) but wasn't compelled enough to move very far beyond the introductions. I do understand the appeal!

You run a platform for 10 years, encourage people to use it under hopes of getting featured on the front page and even getting commissioned work from it and after all that you call it just a “little experiment”?
