Right now I'm playing through the new Shovel Knight expansion and enjoying the mechanics. I still have a stack of Wii U games to get through including Xenoblade Chronicles X, Twilight Princess HD and Kirby and the Rainbow Paintbrush. I'm sure there'll be many games announced that I'd like to play, but I'm contempt to play them in the far future. And, despite being largely unemployed right now, I just don't have the will to play through things as much as I used to.</p>\n","date":"2017-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":1}},{"node":{"title":"Public Speaking","image":"","path":"/blog/2017/05/30/public-speaking/","excerpt":"<p>In my effort to gain human contact, last month I attended the monthly meetup for the Humanist Society of New Zealand.
