During level 4 my work has called off all but priority one urgent jobs, meaning my epic 14 hour days just can’t be done right now. So it’s been closer to 2 hours a day.</p>\n<p>I miss work.</p>\n<p>My sister, her husband, my nephew, two dogs and a giant cat are living with me. They’re between houses, and this was meant to be a brief stopover. It’s… intense. My brother in law works from home, my sister works occasionally, and my nephew has school hours. But that was ok, I work a lot! I’m never home. Ha. Now everyone is at home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/judge.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/judge.jpg\" alt=\"Forza.\"></a>\n<em>Jackjack judges me and observes.</em></p>\n<p>I’m really not cut out for this. They’re not being bad housemates, but I still feel like I’m living in a washing machine full of lead bricks. With my home and even work I’m just used to having agency over what I do! But oh well, I can hardly complain - I will just treat it as a learning experience. </p>\n<p>It’s absolutely making me a better person. If I can’t get through this, I’ll be a sad single bachelor forever. I’ll come out of this exhausted, but I know I’ll be better prepared for all the exciting life stuff coming for me in my post lockdown future.</p>\n<p>I had big, epic plans to move in with my ex-girlfriend in the house we bought. We’d been in love for much less than a year, and now I know without doubt that if we’d stayed together long enough to actually move in it would have been worse. I wasn’t ready, or mature enough, to do that, but this experience with my family is helping me get there! I think I’d need to vibe and gel with someone for 3 to 4 times longer than. 6 months before spending every waking hour at home with them. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/dog.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/dog.jpg\" alt=\"Forza.\"></a>\n<em>Jojo somehow thinks this is the best spot in the house. He also smells.</em></p>\n<p>Writing it down makes it seem extremely obvious that was an unwise thing to do. I think I should spend time writing down my big life decisions and then read them back to better evaluate if they’re wise or bonkers.</p>\n<p>My gums hurt on the bottom left side of my jaw. I got aggressive with the flossing after eating some extremely tough meat. I practice exceptional dental hygiene  - I have to, it’s a family thing - so I’m sure it’ll feel better soon. Still, it’s another thing on the list.</p>\n<p>Work might not be extensive, but I did get a break on day one of the lockdown - a job in Waiouru, about 3 hours’ drive from home. The roads are so eerie when they’re empty! It’s like a ghost movie. I took a 20 minute video of the near empty road for all of you lockdown chums to see what it’s like. </p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 0;\"><div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 25px; height: 0;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ekjukUeVoM0\"></iframe></div></div></p>\n<p>Oddly, there were a large number of campervans out there on the road. Emergency travel only! I’m sure they were just on rural State Highway 1 to go out for milk and toilet paper.</p>\n<p>During the last lockdown I was given the only speeding ticket I’ve ever had in my life, out on those empty roads. This time I have to be more careful - I drive a super sexy Subaru Outback company car now, and if I speed for more than a few seconds my boss gets an alert. It’s okay, I can just put the cruise control on and sit back and enjoy the luxury ride.</p>\n<p>I’m not normally on call for urgent work on weekends; those jobs get handed off to an external company that covers for me when my workload gets a bit much. I’m going to contact my boss to see if I can pick up that weekend work while this lockdown is in place. </p>\n<p>Everyone reading this - please reach out if you need help! I’m driving around in the area a lot, so I can do contactless drop off of things if you don’t want to venture out to the store.</p>\n","date":"2021-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":3,"belongsTo":{"edges":[]}}},"context":{}}
