Well, unfortunately you’re about to find out!</p>\n<p>My title is a Customer Engineer for a wide range of machines that process money: repairing, servicing and installing them in the lower North Island.  I get around! This is my exciting travel diary for Monday 19 July 2021.</p>\n<p>The first thing I did while on the clock was finish off some documentation I was working on. It's a guide on how to clean and service some new hardware we’re rolling out. I enjoy writing, as you probably know, so I'm glad I can do some of that for work.</p>\n<p>After sending that off, I jumped in my white Subaru and hit the road. I'm going to work!</p>\n<p>You might think of a workplace as an office or workshop, but not for me. I have two places I can realistically claim to be my place of work: my car, and a storage unit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/shed.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/shed.jpg\" alt=\"shots.\"></a>\n<em>Luxury workplace, no expense spared.</em></p>\n<p>The storage unit is just a small garage sized lockup where I keep spare parts for work. Not overly glamorous, but fit for purpose. Today I had to ship a part that another engineer needed for a job somewhere else in the country. Oh, parts and logistics. What fun.</p>\n<p>On my way driving to this shed I was assigned my first urgent job of the day.</p>\n<p>In my line of work I have urgent jobs for things that are broken and need to be fixed ASAP, and also jobs that aren’t urgent, like servicing and cleaning of hardware.</p>\n<p>The job that came in this morning was top tier urgent, and far away in Waiouru! After shipping out the spare part, I went on a road trip.</p>\n<p>The most direct route I can take is a horrible windy wide road, but it has the nice benefit of this: Stormy Point Lookout. It's a huge viewpoint that lets you see the rolling rural land for miles and miles. I always try to pull over for 30 seconds to take a photo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/stormy.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/stormy.jpg\" alt=\"shots.\"></a>\n<em>A view for miles and miles and miles.</em></p>\n<p>After 2 hours of driving I hit Waiouru. It's very cold here! The job ended up being much more in depth than I expected, but I got it done.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/tank.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/tank.jpg\" alt=\"shots.\"></a>\n<em>Tanks for the fun, Waiouru.</em></p>\n<p>Before I even started this job, I had another assigned to me: Dannevirke. Unfortunately, before I even could start driving to this job, another job with a higher priority came into my queue: Masterton.</p>\n<p>That's a hell of a drive! But the idea of seeing the giant gumboot gave me the boost I needed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/booty.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/booty.jpg\" alt=\"shots.\"></a>\n<em>I'm a big fan of a big booty.</em></p>\n<p>Waiouru to Masterton is almost the longest drive I have for work. Before, when I was driving my old personal car, it was exhausting to go on such long voyages. But now I have this new machine with the power and features, it's so much more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Oh, in terms of time? I started work at my desk this morning at 8am, and now it's 6pm and I've still got two urgent jobs to finish.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/plane.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/plane.jpg\" alt=\"shots.\"></a>\n<em>I found this yellow aeroplane on my way to Masterton.</em></p>\n<p>Masterton is a nice town! I've been here a lot lately, for both business and pleasure. The one thing I've learned is that everything shuts early, and it becomes a ghost town. To prove this point I took a selfie in the middle of the main street. I could have pitched a tent there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/masterton.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/masterton.jpg\" alt=\"shots.\"></a>\n<em>No nightlife, not even early evening... life.</em></p>\n<p>I often have delays in getting access to the machines I need to work on, and at Masterton I arrived 30 minutes before I could get access. I spent that time writing the majority of this blog post, and going for a brisk walk around downtown. It was extremely cold.</p>\n<p>I was able to resolve the job at Masterton, but due to an ongoing issue with it I’ll be back - either tomorrow or the next day. And it’ll be a very complicated and long task.</p>\n<p>I departed for Dannevirke, and by this point it was dark outside. Doing these long days is so much easier in the summer!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/dannevirke.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/dannevirke.jpg\" alt=\"shots.\"></a>\n<em>Thor says hi.</em></p>\n<p>The Dannevirke job was easy, just a matter of reseating a cable. After doing that it was getting close to 9pm, and I was hoping no new jobs came in - I wanted to go home!</p>\n<p>I was tempted to get some unhealthy takeaways now, as I hadn’t eaten much all day. But no! I got home soon after 10pm and had Weet-Bix with some peanut butter for my dinner.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/dinner.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/dinner.jpg\" alt=\"shots.\"></a>\n<em>Meal of Champions.</em></p>\n<p>I’m tired now. I’d better shower and get some sleep before I do it all over again tomorrow. Goodnight, kids!</p>\n","date":"2021-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":4,"belongsTo":{"edges":[]}}},"context":{}}
