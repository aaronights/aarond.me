But let’s not panic, I’m not frail and fatigued yet!</p>\n<p>I was resigned just to have a night in, but I got invited out. A girl I dated many moons ago took me out to a really nice local place with her partner. It was an awesome night: Pizza, Beer and Banter. Turns out just hanging out with cool people is a fun thing to do!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/drinks.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/drinks.jpg\" alt=\"drinks.\"></a>\n<em>And I didn't used to like beer! Times they are changing.</em></p>\n<p>And after that? I’m slowly realising I might not be the biggest asshole in the world. </p>\n<p>My ex thinks I wronged her in so many ways and never wants to have anything to do with me again. That got to me! I don’t like people hating me, it’s unsettling. With hindsight, it was one of the reasons I was finding it tough to get up and move on. If something is broken, I fix it! I don’t leave it shattered in a million pieces.</p>\n<p>But knowing that the only other person I’ve dated seems to think I’m actually not the biggest asshole in the world has given me a boost. I mean, that relationship didn’t last very long, and was a long time ago. But still. </p>\n<p>I know with my ex I made some bad decisions, but honestly? Not that bad. I made amends for my mistakes as best as I could, and tried to be understanding. If that relationship was going to be successful in the long term these problems would have been things we would have worked through together.</p>\n<p>Another thing I learned that night was that this cool couple were maybe looking to get… A Playstation. No! Cool people don’t do that! How can I sleep at night if I let such a stylish, outgoing and handsome household end up with a damn Sony Playstation. I mean, I want friends! But even I have my limits.</p>\n<p>So I got them an Xbox. <strong><a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-NZ/consoles/xbox-series-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Series S!</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/xboxnote.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/xboxnote.jpg\" alt=\"handwriting.\"></a>\n<em>Don't diss my handwriting.</em></p>\n<p>A bit of a nerdy tangent, but the Series S is an amazing console. It’s such a capable and sleek powerhouse. Last time I went up to Auckland for training I took mine with me in my suitcase - it’s small enough to fit in next to my undies. And this little black and white box doesn’t miss a beat! I’m playing through Jedi: Fallen Order, and with the next gen update it runs super smooth and looks amazing. Right now they’re $549 here in New Zealand - a little steep, but they’re still hard to find on shelves. When the demand eases up and this global semiconductor shortage is over there’ll likely be a price drop - and at $400 they'd be a must have.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/sonicscale.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/sonicscale.jpg\" alt=\"Gin.\"></a>\n<em>Xbox Series S. Sonic the Hedgehog provided for scale.</em></p>\n<p>I gifted the Xbox plus six months of Game Pass, and they’re set. I didn’t have to sweat bullets about what games to give them - they’ve got a huge library to choose from! They’re a very stylish couple, and that sleek little white console will look amazing on their mantle.</p>\n<p>Yes, I’m a mega nerd. That’s my good deed for the week. I’ve improved their lives! I prevented them from making a bad decision that would have led them down a horrific path of sadness and despair.</p>\n<p>Oh, she also took my phone and went on a particular dating app on my behalf. No, I’m not sharing details of how that went here. You’ll just have to guess.\ngit p</p>\n","date":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":3,"belongsTo":{"edges":[]}}},"context":{}}
