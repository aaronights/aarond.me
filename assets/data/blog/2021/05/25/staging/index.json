I seem to be up here more and more frequently these days! It's really nice. I enjoy heading into the office and being able to see all the awesome people I normally only email or phone.</p>\n<p>No drunken shenanigans this time; I didn't get locked out of the hotel room in my undies.</p>\n<p>That caramel slice I made? I took it to the office and it all went! I was pleased at how well it survived transport in my carry-on bag. My boss, my boss’s boss, my boss’s boss’s boss and Karl all liked it! The secret is all in the caramel. Maybe my ego is just getting too big, but I'm very proud.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/slicegone.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/slicegone.jpg\" alt=\"slicegone.\"></a>\n<em>And those last four pieces were gone before I left.</em></p>\n<p>Speaking of bosses, I realised just how much the management at my work really goes into bat for me. I work hard and scarcely get any feedback, but when I asked about how it was looking for me to get a full time salaried job, he showed me a PowerPoint presentation he was going to present to international senior management basically stating how they'd better hire me and a few other contractors before we jump ship!</p>\n<p>Someone loves me, even if my ex doesn't.</p>\n<p>I also spoke to another boss about my hours - he's asked me to come up with a working roster for after-hours work. He's really given me the freedom to choose what hours I want to do (within reason!). I absolutely want to keep doing the late shift - sometimes when I get home early, I get bored sitting there eagerly waiting for jobs to come in of an evening. I'm just not sure if I want to keep doing five days a week 8 till 11, or if I want to transition to alternating weeks on call. I'll have to think about it.</p>\n<p>The CBD area around the office and the hotel I stay at has become so familiar to me. It's entrenched with memories - not of Auckland, but of what has been happening in my life when I've been here. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/streets.jpeg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/streets.jpeg\" alt=\"slicegone.\"></a>\n<em>Written on these streets are the stories that I can't explain.</em></p>\n<p>The first time I was up here? I was on top of the world! I felt amazing. I remember places where I bought Christmas presents, and where I was when I was on the phone to a certain someone. I remember feeling guilty that I was away yet having such a good time up here.</p>\n<p>The second time I was here I was at an all time low, struggling to recover and having booze for the first time in 10,000 years. Yeah, I’m still embarrassed about what happened, especially when I found out that everyone in the office knows! Does it count as office gossip if everyone already knows what happened?</p>\n<p>This time? I'm good. I mean, I'm not great! But I can't complain about how stuff is going right now. I still have a massive empty hole in me, but somehow I seem okay to not be in a rush to fill it. Everyone says it will happen, from my skepical best friend Mark to my kick ass colleague Jazz. Thank you! You empower me heaps.</p>\n<p>Being around myself every day, I don't really have a view on how I've progressed, but having these semi-annual trips away acts as a kind of checkpoint. It gives me an opportunity to reflect on who I am, where I've come from and maybe even where I'm going.</p>\n<p>I might be moving forward. I might be moving sideways. Heck, I might just be staying in one place dancing really awkwardly! But right now I can absolutely say I'm not moving backwards.</p>\n<p>And that's an achievement worth unlocking.</p>\n","date":"2021-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":3,"belongsTo":{"edges":[]}}},"context":{}}
