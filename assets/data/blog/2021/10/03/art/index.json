I'm really keen to paint and renovate this place extensively, but there just isn't anyone available to do it. I got told I had a one year lead time on getting a new kitchen renovated and installed. I very much want to paint and redecorate my entire house - it's the best investment I can make!</p>\n<p>So, while I wait for tradespeople to be available, I'm getting into… art.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/nook.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/nook.jpg\" alt=\"New Bed.\"></a>\n<em>I'm glad I don't have to repay more debt to this guy!</em></p>\n<p>You've already seen my coloured giraffe, but now Tom Nook sits below him! It's a cool cushion, and as the summer months get here and the old gas heater is never used, he'll be a nice decoration for the unused appliance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/beach.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/beach.jpg\" alt=\"New Bed.\"></a>\n<em>Surf's up.</em></p>\n<p>The beach! It's a nice canvas print, and adds a bit of spice to the room.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/darkflowers.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/darkflowers.jpg\" alt=\"New Bed.\"></a>\nDark Flowers._</p>\n<p>In the dining room I've got a dark floral print. It's flowers without being flowery! I like the tone; it contrasts well with the afternoon sun that shines in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/mars.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/mars.jpg\" alt=\"New Bed.\"></a>\n<em>Oppotunity.</em></p>\n<p>Finally, it's Opportunity! The Mars Rover is in the hallway. It's a fabric print - I'm not too pleased with how it looks framed, so I'll try to find a better solution sometime.</p>\n<p>The next thing I want to do is overhaul all my curtains. Here in the living room they're very… brown. Plastering and painting might be a year away, but I'm sure I can fit new curtains myself!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/curtains.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/curtains.jpg\" alt=\"New Bed.\"></a>\n<em>Anything would be an improvement over this!</em></p>\n<p>Any tips? What's the best place to shop for curtains in the area? I want something notable. Striking, even! Much less brown, much more impact.</p>\n<p>I sold my old car today. It's good to finally have it gone! It was never getting use now that I have the company car, and it's nice to be able to cancel the insurance. That green machine was the last car my dad bought and even drove, so it's a little bit of personal history that has gone. With work I spent a lot of time in that car, and even had some fun in it. Oh, the fun! But those details aren't things I can share here. Use your imagination.</p>\n<p>So, give me your curtain suggestions! All suggestions related to design and colour are appreciated - I have no trust in my own skills in this area. I’ll be having a go at stripping and painting the house, starting with the living room, but if anyone knows someone that can remove and install a kitchen? Send them my way!</p>\n","date":"2021-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":2,"belongsTo":{"edges":[]}}},"context":{}}
