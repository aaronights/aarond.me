Even though my life and my lifestyle have changed so much, it still doesn’t feel like two whole years. I'm definitely not the same person I was back then, I've learned and experienced a lot! But still.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/gus.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/gus.jpg\" alt=\"gus.\"></a>\n<em>These two loved a midday snooze.</em></p>\n<p>I miss Dad. He was just an awesome person, and someone that I'm still very proud of. </p>\n<p>And I know he'd like the company car they gave me. A big white Subaru Outback. It's actually making my days a lot less exhausting. I've got ample space to fit giant parts in so I'm not always juggling stuff around. Plus driving it is a lot less stressful. The fancy adaptive cruise control just means a lot less fidgeting about. If there's a car ahead of you, just lock it in and it'll keep pace with it. It makes my many, many hours of driving each day just seem a little bit less like work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/car.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/car.jpg\" alt=\"car.\"></a>\n<em>White Tiger Subaru Power!</em></p>\n<p>Oh, but I need to be careful. On the way back from Dannevirke earlier in the week I eagerly passed two semi trucks in a short passing lane. The Subaru did it well! I zoomed passed, smooth as butter! But, it's a company car, and if I speed my boss gets a notification. </p>\n<p>It was a bad judgement call on my end. Call it the excitement of a new toy! But now I take a much more relaxed approach to driving. I won't be having that need for speed again.</p>\n<p>And, in another revelation, I'm incredibly insecure. Talking with a friend really got me to realize this. Here I am being and working alone, and I'm just not… confident and sure of myself. It's probably why my past (and only) two relationships didn't work out. I just was always demanding so much reassurance and compassion from the other person that it pushed them away. I become possessive and somewhat obsessive, and put so much pressure on the other person. </p>\n<p>I have to learn to be more assured in myself and my life in general. A needy and insecure me cannot be part of a happy and healthy relationship, no matter how cool, funny, smart, caring, good looking and interesting I am. </p>\n<p>I'm all of those things, by the way. Just in case you didn't already notice! </p>\n<p>And, you know what? Stuffs going pretty damn good for me. I've got a job I enjoy, I'm good at and that pays well. Many people live long lives never having that. I also have a house, a company car and extremely cool shoes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/shoes.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/shoes.jpg\" alt=\"car.\"></a>\n<em>I got style, I got class.</em></p>\n<p>Work is very fulfilling, being the world's most bestest uncle is the most satisfying thing ever! And I love to be able to do nice things for cool people.</p>\n<p>But to succeed? To get what I want? I need to work on finding gratification from within me, rather than external sources. And that actually sounds like something I can do. </p>\n","date":"2021-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":2,"belongsTo":{"edges":[]}}},"context":{}}
