The most annoying thing is how positive I feel all the interviews go. I get along well with the people plus I am familiar with every scenario and software environment that is brought up. I'd like to think I could learn something from each and every interview, but even with a time machine I have no idea how I could go back and change things to improve my chances. I almost wish I was crashing and burning so I could clearly see how I would improve things for next time.</p>\n<p>Am I doing something wrong? Ugh, probably not. There is a whole boatload of people after work in this city, only the most arrogant would assume they are automatically the best person for a job.</p>\n<p>Right now my savings are melting away as I pay for rent and living out of the savings. I get up every morning and get on my good old Chuwi to investigate any new job listings that have popped up. I craft a nice cover letter for whatever listings I think I have a 1% chance of getting, hit submit and wait. I also try to follow up, but not being annoying is key when seeking employment.</p>\n<p>I also have a little bit of a cough. Not too bad, but enough to be a pain. It doesn't help that my rented place can get a bit damp, requiring the windows to be open during the day to help dry it out. If I can hold out to summer I'm sure this place will be great, though.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fo__Sh0nIg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">I know I can't hold on much longer</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fo__Sh0nIg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">…but I will never let go</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fo__Sh0nIg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">I know that it's a one way track</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fo__Sh0nIg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">…tell me now how long this'll last</a></p>\n<p>Wasn't 1999 such a simpler time? I would start playing Sonic Adventure, but I'm sure I'd be disappointed that it doesn't live up to how I remember it.
