Right now I'm playing through the new Shovel Knight expansion and enjoying the mechanics. I still have a stack of Wii U games to get through including Xenoblade Chronicles X, Twilight Princess HD and Kirby and the Rainbow Paintbrush. I'm sure there'll be many games announced that I'd like to play, but I'm contempt to play them in the far future. And, despite being largely unemployed right now, I just don't have the will to play through things as much as I used to.</p>\n<p>As most of you probably know, for a while I just haven't been feeling great.</p>\n<p>The headlines don't help. Horrible and disgusting things are happening around the world. Innocent people are being murdered through no fault or foreseeable action of their own. These are good people! They have friends and family that care for them, that depend on them. They are out and about, loving life and striving to be more and do more things.</p>\n<p>I want, strongly, to switch places with them. Their lives are taken on a whim, without any consideration at the personal level, by evil people that just want to kill. But the world doesn't work like that, there is no auction house you can donate your life to in order to save others from a malicious death.</p>\n<p>I bet the use of drugs and alcohol are going up, but I'm not interested in deluding myself artificially. The only way I'm going to get anywhere is to have a clear and factual understanding of my actual situation, no matter how bad it might be.</p>\n","date":"2017-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":1,"belongsTo":{"edges":[]}}},"context":{}}
