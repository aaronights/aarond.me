Right now I'm playing through the new Shovel Knight expansion and enjoying the mechanics. I still have a stack of Wii U games to get through including Xenoblade Chronicles X, Twilight Princess HD and Kirby and the Rainbow Paintbrush. I'm sure there'll be many games announced that I'd like to play, but I'm contempt to play them in the far future. And, despite being largely unemployed right now, I just don't have the will to play through things as much as I used to.</p>\n","date":"2017-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":1}},{"node":{"title":"Public Speaking","image":"","path":"/blog/2017/05/30/public-speaking/","excerpt":"<p>In my effort to gain human contact, last month I attended the monthly meetup for the Humanist Society of New Zealand.

When high noon or the evening rolls around I just lack motivation to prepare anything worth eating. Cheap things you can buy ready made are always full of salt and fat. Takeaways in this small town are limited to the main burger chains or a giant deep fried smorgasbord.</p>\n","date":"2017-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":2}},{"node":{"title":"Suicide","image":"","path":"/blog/2017/05/02/suicide/","excerpt":"<p>This is a tough subject, a strong taboo in society. But after watching 13 Reason Why I feel urged to write about my perspective on suicide. I found the show very compelling, the writing is excellent and the characters are very well realised.

Here in the small nation of New Zealand the number of options available isn't as big as some other places around the world, but here I will review in great detail the seven varieties I was able to purchase locally.</p>\n","date":"2016-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":4}}]}},"context":{}}
