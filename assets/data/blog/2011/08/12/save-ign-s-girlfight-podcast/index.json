The show has a variable cast, but currently the most common lineup consists of Xbox editor Kristine Steimer, editor and guide writer extraordinaire Stephanie Lee, IGNs on camera host Naomi Kyle, community overlord Tina Sanchez and community manager of 1UP.com Janine Dong. The crew has fun and reasonably grounded discussions offering insight into their personal and professional video game lives from a perspective most IGN readers don't have.</p>\n<p>The issue behind Girlfight's cancellation is its numbers; it doesn't get the same number of listeners as some of IGNs other shows. Girlfight isn't about corny one liners or cheap catch phrases. Its not about grabbing listeners attention with flashy promotions and cheesy innuendos. It's not necessarily better than those other shows, its different. And that variety should be celebrated and embraced.</p>\n<p>Girlfight also doesn't really get the promotion of the other IGN shows. Notice the feedback email address? It's a basic Gmail one. It makes one wonder if the senior staff wants Girlfight to succeed in the first place.</p>\n<p>Since the team from 1UP moved into the IGN offices, time in the podcast room has reached a premium. My rough calculations have 10 regular shows being produced out of the San Francisco office, giving the smaller shows the squeeze. Recording time might be getting tight, but surely it's something good planning can resolve.</p>\n<p>Girlfight is a unique podcast that IGN should be proud of. The integrity, maturity and perspective of the conversation is something not found on any other show on the network. If you haven't listened to it I encourage you to give it a try.</p>\n<p><strong>Save Girlfight. Promote Girlfight. And let it thrive and prosper.</strong></p>\n","date":"2011-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":1,"belongsTo":{"edges":[]}}},"context":{}}
