The Kickstarter campaign for Retronauts has really taken off, having reached its goal within a few hours and now has over four times what it asked for with 24 days still remaining.</p>\n<p>My obscure time zone and eager alertness allowed me to get one of the higher tier rewards before they were sold out. I was lucky enough get the $150 option to decide the topic of an entire episode. But right now, I don't have any great ideas! I'd love to hear any suggestions that you might have to what Bob and his team could rave on about for 90 minutes. Any suggestions are welcome, I'd love to be able to provide a topic that hasn't been discussed in the 160 episode history of Retronauts. Some topics do need a few more years of hindsight and additional discussion, so sequel suggestions would be great too.</p>\n<p>Leave a comment below or buzz me up on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aaronights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a>.
