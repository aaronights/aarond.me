It was the real deal! Extra large tents, barbeques, mosquitoes - the works. There might have been a plug to charge a phone, but that'd be about it. Hipsters could call it a digital detox. The idea of a whole week without screens, games and lines of code made him shiver.</p>\n<p>He's a camper to the core, though. Play Halo or any other shooter and he likes to find a spot with something Sniper-able and camp until dawn.</p>\n<p>So how does one cope with such a strong technology withdrawal? You don't!</p>\n<p>I got together a plastic box and some bungee cords, and mounted my old 40 inch display and a Wii U in the back of my Mazda 2.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/WiiUCar.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/WiiUCar.jpg\" alt=\"Goofy.\"></a>\n<em>I'm the goofy thumbs up guy, if you wondered.</em></p>\n<p>I used the Wii U rather than my Xbox One or PC just due to its low power use. Reports claim that a Wii U nominally draws around 34 watts. I could manage that off the car's starting battery for an hour or so, but the 150-plus watts that an alternative system would demand just wouldn't last.</p>\n<p>The TV is the LED backlit LCD panel I was using prior to Black Friday. It's unbranded and lacks any extra features - and that's ideal! I'm sure some kind of fancy image processing or smart user interface would just drive up the power draw. Ths sticker on the back says it'll use a maximum of 58 watts - very reasonable considering its size.</p>\n<p>Both the Wii U and the display do run off DC. If I wanted extreme efficiency I could have rectified a smooth 15v rail to go directly into the Wii U and build a little power box to provide both the 5 and 12 volt rails the TV uses internally. But I wasn't going to be that pedantic! I purchased a cheap inverter online that connects to a standard car accessory socket. It claimed to be able to provide a constant 150 watt output - impressive considering its only cooling was a tiny fan. No doubt the power coming out of it wasn't very smooth, undoubtedly a crude stepped AC sine wave. I was a little hesitant to plug everything together, mildly concerned about potential damage. Thankfully there were no such issues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/PlayingwithPower.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/PlayingwithPower.jpg\" alt=\"Power.\"></a>\n<em>Now you're playing with Power!</em></p>\n<p>Everyone loved it! The adults enjoyed playing a few rounds of Mario Kart, and enjoyed it even more when the kids sat still for an hour or two and did the same. A few other hits were 7-player Smash Bros (where no one actually could tell what was going on) and the Artwork mode of Game and Wario.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/HowItsDone.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/HowItsDone.jpg\" alt=\"How It&#x27;s Done.\"></a>\n<em>This is how it's done, kids!</em></p>\n<p>I partook of some non-digital activities too. Mountain biking to a little artisan brewery and turning tomato red swimming all afternoon were highlights. Overall it was a fun time! I'm just glad I got to drive home, just up the road, to my nice normal bed every night.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/images/blog/InDark.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/blog/InDark.jpg\" alt=\"In the dark.\"></a>\n<em>It's not like I was winning or anything.</em></p>\n<p>Not to drag things down, but I did have somewhat of a rough time over the holiday break. Nothing important! It was something of my own making. My head got a bit worked up and let something trivial and unimportant get to me. It's all over now, dead and buried. I just feel bad that I got so down while everyone around me was enjoying their vacation.</p>\n<p>In the future? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxL_r-0VC1k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">I ain't gonna let it get to me.</a></p>\n","date":"2019-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":3}},"context":{}}
