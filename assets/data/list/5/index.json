When high noon or the evening rolls around I just lack motivation to prepare anything worth eating. Cheap things you can buy ready made are always full of salt and fat. Takeaways in this small town are limited to the main burger chains or a giant deep fried smorgasbord.</p>\n","date":"2017-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":2}},{"node":{"title":"Suicide","path":"/blog/2017/05/02/suicide/","excerpt":"<p>This is a tough subject, a strong taboo in society. But after watching 13 Reason Why I feel urged to write about my perspective on suicide. I found the show very compelling, the writing is excellent and the characters are very well realised.

I don't partake too often, but when I need it I go for an energy drink. To keep the calorie count down, I generally prefer sugar free varieties. Here in the small nation of New Zealand the number of options available isn't as big as some other places around the world, but here I will review in great detail the seven varieties I was able to purchase locally.</p>\n","date":"2016-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":4}},{"node":{"title":"Video with the Raspberry Pi","path":"/blog/2016/04/25/video-with-the-raspberry-pi/","excerpt":"<p>While a Baby Monitor might not be something the IGN community would be interested in, I've done a neat live video streaming project with the Raspberry Pi and the new NoIR V2 camera.

The ultra low cost, single board computer is making roads in both education and the do-it-yourself maker scene.
